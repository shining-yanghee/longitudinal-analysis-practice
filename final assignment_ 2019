-What is the average Unemployment benefit II across all time points and respondents? 
Overall mean is 756.0318 and overall variation is 2620.091.
-What is the within and between variation?
(results from 'xtsum' command)
Between variation (Standard deviation) is 2,888.64 and within variation is 1,105.183.
Differences between persons are larger than those of within an individual overtime.
So, we can assume individuals who get unemployment benefits are more likely to get the benefits, 
whereas those without benefits are less likely to do.

*Exercise 2-(a)

/*
Step 1 and 2 are for processes of data preparation. 
In the step 1, with loop, data between 1984 and 2010 will be combined. 
'pfad' is about basic demographic household and personal data.
With the first 'foreach', certain variable, such as life satisfaction and nation, are extracted and renamed.
And then, those data from 1985 to 2010 are attached to the first wave, 1984, by the 'append' command. 
The attached file is saved as 'master.dta'.
In the step 2, 'pfad' data of 1999 is worked. A variable of ��persnr�� is changed to ��id��. 
And certain meaningful variables such as ��sex�� and ��gebjahr�� are extracted. Rests of other variables are thrown away. 
Then, with a ��merge�� command, the data is logically combined to the ��master.dta�� file by the ��id�� variable. 
��1:m�� can match the data to correspond ��One-to-many�� data on ��id��. While using ��merge��, Stata creates a column ��_merge�� on the merge status. 
The value ��3�� of the column ��_merge�� means that two merged data are exactly matched to each other. 
The value ��1�� of that is not matched. So, the user can notice where the unmet data comes from.
For the longitudinal analysis, the data should be organized with 'xtdes' and 'xtset'.
The 'year' variable that is created in the loop command works as the wave for the data set.

/*'relstat', 'hhincnet', and 'marry' are highly correlated with 'happy'. 'relstat' has higher correlation with 'happy' than 'marry'. 
This is because the concept of 'relstat' include more information such as cohabition without marry, which can affect the happiness level for individuals.
But, the coefficient of 'marry' in the FE model is insignificant and the smallest among the pooled OLS, the RE model, and the FE model.
Significance of 'marry' in the pooled OLS and the RE models disappear in the FE model. This is interpreted as that the happier are easier to get married.
With respect to 'age', the older are less happy than the younger (between variation) possibly due to health problems, 
but within a individual, it's not valid that happiness of happier people doesn't matter whether aging or not.
Also, household income is significantly correlated to 'happy'. 
But, the coefficient of 'hhincnet' in the FE model is the smallest among the pooled OLS, the RE model, and the FE model.
This partially reveals selective bias for the individuals that origianlly happier people earn more than less happy people. 
But, it's still significant of 0.056 in the FE model at the 1% level of the confidence interval.
Considering the results of Breusch and Pagan test and Hausman test with insignificance of the FE model, 
there should be selective bias and the FE model should be adopted rather than the pooled OLS and the RE model.

/*In 3-(c), the FE model's within R-square value is 0.0032. After introducing 'mardur', the explanatory power of the model increase by 0.0122.
For the variables, 'marry' and 'mardur', singles are equally dropped out in the FE model which removes individuals who don't have any change.
But the difference is in 'mardur' that observations with changes can reflect more detailed information across the period as time goes by.
The information of 'marry' is at maxium 6 times, but 'mardur' provides at maximum 72 times within the observation window.
'mardur' is more appropriate for the impact fuction which can tract changes on the dependent variable over time.
In the following FE model with an event-time clock dummy of 'i.mardur', I cannot find out any linear or curvlinear relationship, in spite of the high R-square value (0.1437) and significance of temporal effects (F-test). 
On the middle of the marriage duration, negative coefficients in the event-time dummy temporally appeared and disappeared.
There might be other possible factors such as child and economic conditions, which can affect the depedent variable of 'happy'.
